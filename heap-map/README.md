## About the project

This is the **Visualize Data with a Heat Map** project, created as part of the freeCodeCamp Data Visualization certification.
The objective is to build a web app that visualizes data using a heap map.

## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- D3.js

## User Stories

The app should fulfill the following user stories and pass all of the provided tests.

1. **User Story #1**: My heat map should have a title with a corresponding id="title".
2. **User Story #2**: My heat map should have a description with a corresponding id="description".
3. **User Story #3**: My heat map should have an x-axis with a corresponding id="x-axis".
4. **User Story #4**: My heat map should have a y-axis with a corresponding id="y-axis".
5. **User Story #5**: My heat map should have rect elements with a class="cell" that represent the data.
6. **User Story #6**: There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the cells.
7. **User Story #7**: Each cell will have the properties data-month, data-year, data-temp containing their corresponding month, year, and temperature values.
8. **User Story #8**: The data-month, data-year of each cell should be within the range of the data.
9. **User Story #9**: My heat map should have cells that align with the corresponding month on the y-axis.
10. **User Story #10**: My heat map should have cells that align with the corresponding year on the x-axis.
11. **User Story #11**: My heat map should have multiple tick labels on the y-axis with the full month name.
12. **User Story #12**: My heat map should have multiple tick labels on the x-axis with the years between 1754 and 2015.
13. **User Story #13**: My heat map should have a legend with a corresponding id="legend".
14. **User Story #14**: My legend should contain rect elements.
15. **User Story #15**: The rect elements in the legend should use at least 4 different fill colors.
16. **User Story #16**: I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area.
17. **User Story #17**: My tooltip should have a data-year property that corresponds to the data-year of the active area.
