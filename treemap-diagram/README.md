## User Stories

The app should fulfill the following user stories and pass all of the provided tests.

1. **User Story #1**: My tree map should have a title with a corresponding id="title".

4. **User Story #4**: There should be at least 2 different fill colors used for the tiles.
5. **User Story #5**: Each tile should have the properties data-name, data-category, and data-value containing their corresponding name, category, and value.
6. **User Story #6**: The area of each tile should correspond to the data-value amount: tiles with a larger data-value should have a bigger area.
7. **User Story #7**: My tree map should have a legend with corresponding id="legend".
8. **User Story #8**: My legend should have rect elements with a corresponding class="legend-item".
9. **User Story #9**: The rect elements in the legend should use at least 2 different fill colors.
